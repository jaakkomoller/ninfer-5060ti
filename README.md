# NInfer

> Selected checkpoints. Maximum single-GPU inference performance.

NInfer is a from-scratch C++/CUDA inference engine for the Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6 checkpoints listed
below on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090. It runs text, image, and video prompts through a local
CLI or OpenAI-/Anthropic-compatible HTTP APIs.

NInfer deliberately supports a closed set of model artifacts instead of acting as a general model
runtime:

| Model | Weights | NInfer artifact | Size | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| [Qwen3.5-9B](https://huggingface.co/ruwwww/qwen3.5-9b-ninfer) | `groupwise-int` | `qwen3_5_9b.ninfer` | 6,514,051,328 bytes (6.07 GiB) | `5e823ea5b4df7c75c630cb5ff90017cf17769c68bbf9545640cf981af5ec7bd6` |
| [Qwen3.6-27B](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.6-27B-NInfer) | `groupwise-int` | `qwen3_6_27b.ninfer` | 17,495,365,888 bytes (16.29 GiB) | `7b51600ffd10632b9660f56085efdd9b751d79733ad32036a652234b64bebe7b` |
| [Qwen3.6-27B NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.6-27B-nvfp4-NInfer) | `nvfp4` | `qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4.ninfer` | 18,324,064,000 bytes (17.07 GiB) | `bce5f00d066c0f20f1317bf1fdcb458264cf95837c3b1f3fbec163694627893a` |
| [Qwen3.6-35B-A3B](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NInfer) | `groupwise-int` | `qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer` | 22,783,246,080 bytes (21.22 GiB) | `1fb9ea0b5b8561e49d9604115ec89e5d9f2b6f6434e32c37c57fffd480a325d2` |

The 9B artifact binds to the registered `qwen3_5_9b` target: a 4,096-wide, 32-layer dense model
with a mixed linear/full-attention backbone (24 linear-attention and 8 full-attention layers) and
one MTP layer, quantized to the same groupwise-int profile as the 27B/35B-A3B targets. Prefill
activations match the source BF16 model exactly (top-10 logits byte-identical), and greedy decode
tracks the reference until near-tie logits fall within quantization drift.

Both 27B artifacts bind to the same registered `qwen3_6_27b` target; the version-2 artifact identity
selects the weight profile without a separate target or runtime flag. The `nvfp4` profile uses W4A4
Tensor Core MMA for prefill and A16 NVFP4 kernels for decode while retaining the same Text, Vision,
MTP, prefix-reuse, CLI, and serving paths. The `qwen3_5_9b` target is a peer of these two: it
shares the family Text/Vision/MTP schedules and the groupwise-int execution leaves, specialized
for its own dimensions (see the
[9B artifact reference](docs/maintainer/qwen3.5-9b-artifact.md)).

## Performance

Serving performance was measured on an RTX 5090 with INT8 group-64 KV cache, CUDA Graphs, a 1,024-
token prefill chunk, and a maximum context of 262,144 tokens. Each reported fixture uses five fixed
seeds after one warm-up. The registered targets are reported independently and are not
cross-target comparisons. The two 27B weight profiles are reported separately.

**Qwen3.5-9B (`groupwise-int`)**

- Greedy short-prompt serving (no speculation): **~793 prefill tok/s** and **~241 decode tok/s**.
- MTP3 short-prompt decode: **~450 decode tok/s** with **~84% acceptance** (3.5 tokens/round).

**Qwen3.6-35B-A3B**

- MTP0 at a 7,680-token prompt: **15,544.3 prefill tok/s** and **271.1 decode tok/s**.
- MTP0 at a 260,096-token prompt: **5,157.1 prefill tok/s** and **188.2 decode tok/s**.
- MTP3 long reasoning: **584.0–695.1 decode tok/s** with **72.4–83.3% acceptance**.
- MTP3 structured output: **714.3 decode tok/s**, **87.7% acceptance**, and **3.63 tokens/round**.

**Qwen3.6-27B (`groupwise-int`)**

- MTP0 at a 7,680-token prompt: **3,218.1 prefill tok/s** and **77.6 decode tok/s**.
- MTP0 at a 260,096-token prompt: **1,614.8 prefill tok/s** and **54.8 decode tok/s**.
- MTP3 long reasoning: **161.9–175.4 decode tok/s** with **73.4–78.8% acceptance**.
- MTP3 structured output: **193.0 decode tok/s**, **88.7% acceptance**, and **3.66 tokens/round**.

**Qwen3.6-27B (`nvfp4`)**

- MTP0 at a 7,680-token prompt: **11,191.5 prefill tok/s** and **86.4 decode tok/s**.
- MTP0 at a 260,096-token prompt: **2,510.6 prefill tok/s** and **59.9 decode tok/s**.
- MTP3 long reasoning: **201.6–222.7 decode tok/s** with **74.7–80.8% acceptance**.
- MTP3 structured output: **243.1 decode tok/s**, **90.2% acceptance**, and **3.71 tokens/round**.
- Against groupwise-int on the same corpus and runtime options: **3.48× the 7,680-token prefill
  throughput**, **1.55× the 260,096-token prefill throughput**, and **25–28% higher MTP3 decode
  throughput**.

and per-fixture results.

## Evaluation

Capability scores were measured through NInfer's OpenAI-compatible serving route with thinking
enabled, MTP=3, and EvalScope 1.9.0 (0-shot, rule scoring, one sample per problem):

| Model profile | AIME 2025 | AIME 2026 | GPQA-Diamond |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| [Qwen3.6-27B groupwise-int](model-cards/Qwen3.6-27B-NInfer/README.md) | 86.67% | 93.33% | 86.87% |
| [Qwen3.6-27B NVFP4](model-cards/Qwen3.6-27B-nvfp4-NInfer/README.md) | 93.33% | 93.33% | 84.34% |
| [Qwen3.6-35B-A3B groupwise-int](model-cards/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NInfer/README.md) | 90.00% | 90.00% | 85.35% |

These are single-sample results under that NInfer evaluation profile, not pass@k. See the model
cards and [full performance document](docs/performance.md) for correct/total counts and evaluation
notes.

## Requirements

NInfer currently requires:

- 64-bit Linux;
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (`sm_120a`);
- NVIDIA driver support for CUDA 13.1 and the CUDA Toolkit 13.1 or newer;
- CMake 3.28 or newer and a C++20-capable host compiler;
- `pkg-config`;
- FFmpeg development libraries: `libavformat >= 60`, `libavcodec >= 60`,
  `libavutil >= 58`, and `libswscale >= 7`;
- `libcurl >= 7.85`;
- Ninja, when using the commands below.

The build rejects CUDA architectures other than `120a`. There is no install target or packaged
binary distribution; NInfer is run from its source build tree.

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer.git
cd ninfer

cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
```

The default configuration builds:

```text
build/apps/ninfer
build/apps/ninfer-serve
```

Tests, benchmarks, and maintainer tools are excluded from the default build.

## Docker

Build the runtime image on a 64-bit Linux host with an RTX 5090, a CUDA 13.1-compatible NVIDIA
driver, Docker, and the
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

```bash
docker build --tag ninfer:local .
```

Download a model into `models/` as described below, then run the HTTP server:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --gpus '"device=0"' \
  --publish 8080:8080 \
  --volume "$PWD/models:/models:ro" \
  ninfer:local \
  ninfer-serve /models/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --model-id qwen3.6-27b
```

Run the CLI from the same image:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --gpus '"device=0"' \
  --volume "$PWD/models:/models:ro" \
  ninfer:local \
  ninfer /models/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --prompt "Explain prefill and decode in three sentences." \
  --max-new 256
```

## Download a model

Use the Hugging Face CLI to download one of the registered artifacts:

```bash
hf download ruwwww/qwen3.5-9b-ninfer \
  qwen3_5_9b.ninfer \
  --local-dir models

# Or the 27B weight variants:
hf download neroued/Qwen3.6-27B-NInfer \
  qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --local-dir models

# Or the 27B NVFP4 weight variant:
hf download neroued/Qwen3.6-27B-nvfp4-NInfer \
  qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --local-dir models

# Or:
hf download neroued/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NInfer \
  qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer \
  --local-dir models
```

Current NInfer builds accept only the version-2 artifact container, and all four downloads above
are version 2. If an older 27B or 35B-A3B artifact was downloaded before this publication, migrate
that exact local file in place:

```bash
python3 -m tools.artifact.migrate_v1_to_v2 models/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer
```

Use the same command with `qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer` for the 35B-A3B artifact. The migration updates
only container metadata; it does not rewrite the weight payload. Alternatively, download the
current version-2 file again from its Hugging Face repository.

Each `.ninfer` file contains the weights and frontend resources needed by NInfer. It is not a
Transformers checkpoint, Safetensors distribution, or GGUF file.

Each artifact is complete, while GPU residency is fixed at process startup. Speculative decoding is
disabled by default, so MTP/DFlash state and the optimized proposal head are not uploaded.
Vision is also disabled by default, so its weights, Vision scratch phase, and frozen
request-transient allocation are omitted. Add `--vision` to the CLI or server process that must
accept image or video input. Disabled capabilities cannot be enabled by a later request. DFlash is
available only for the 35B-A3B target and is text-only.

## Run the CLI

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --prompt "Explain prefill and decode in three sentences." \
  --max-context 16384 \
  --max-new 256 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

Use `--messages FILE` instead of `--prompt` for chat history, images, or videos:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --messages examples/cli/messages/image_chart.json \
  --max-context 8192 \
  --max-new 128 \
  --vision
```

Answer content is written to stdout. Loading progress, reasoning, timing, throughput, memory, and
speculative-decoding statistics are written to stderr. See the [CLI guide](docs/cli.md) and
[committed examples](examples/cli/) for structured input and runtime options.

## Run the HTTP server

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --model-id qwen3.6-27b \
  --max-context 16384 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

Then send an OpenAI-style request:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.6-27b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Reply with one short sentence."}],
    "max_tokens": 64
  }'
```

The server also implements Anthropic Messages, streaming, token counting, multimodal input, and
function-tool request/response translation. See [HTTP serving](docs/serving.md).

## Capabilities

All registered model targets support:

- text generation with thinking and non-thinking prompt modes;
- image, multi-image, video, and mixed multimodal messages;
- chunked prefill and CUDA Graph decode;
- MTP speculative decoding with draft windows from one to five;
- BF16 and INT8 group-64 KV cache;
- greedy, temperature, top-k, top-p, min-p, and presence/frequency-penalty sampling;
- compatible-prefix reuse;
- OpenAI Chat Completions and Anthropic Messages, including streaming and usage accounting;
- prompt-rendered function tools and parsed tool calls.

## Current limits

- Only the model targets listed above are accepted product targets.
- Execution is specialized for one RTX 5090 and one CUDA device.
- One Engine owns one resident sequence and runs one active request at a time.
- Continuous batching, multi-GPU execution, CPU/GPU offload, and distributed serving are not
  implemented.
- Context capacity is configurable up to the registered models' native 262,144-token limit, subject
  to GPU memory and KV-cache configuration.
- Tool calls are parsed and returned to the client; NInfer does not execute tools.
- The C++ headers are used by the in-tree applications and are not distributed as an installed SDK.
